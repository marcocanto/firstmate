# Shared durable, supervisor-facing outcome publication for a confirmed merge.
#
# Both a merge performed by this home and a merge detected by its existing poll
# use this operation, so neither outcome depends on an agent remembering it.
# This operation publishes the poll's local actionable row; the watcher
# immediately delivers that row as observation handling, not a second outcome
# path.
#
# The destination is the home's role, never the caller's choice:
#   - a secondmate home reports upward on its parent channel, resolved and
#     appended through bin/fm-parent-channel-lib.sh under its channel contract;
#   - a main home reports to the captain through the durable wake queue.
# A poll observed in a secondmate home also receives a local durable wake after
# the upward write, so the mate can handle its own poll observation.
# No new state file and no new transport are involved.
#
# Normal operation deduplicates the task's latest canonical PR identity through
# the merge-notification marker owned by bin/fm-pr-lib.sh. Main-home wake keys
# also include that PR identity so distinct PRs for a reused task remain
# distinct in queue presentation. The outcome is published before the marker
# is committed, so a failed commit stays eligible for at-least-once retry and
# may rarely duplicate rather than leave a merge silent.
#
# fm_merge_unqueued_report publishes the other poll outcome the same way: GitHub
# took a pull request this home queued back out of the merge queue without
# merging it. It uses the same destination rules and wake shape, keyed by the
# queueing epoch so each removal reports once and a later queueing reports
# again. A confirmed merge also consumes the queue marker.
#
# Sourced by bin/fm-pr-merge.sh, bin/fm-watch.sh, and tests. No side effects on
# source beyond its sourced libraries.

# fm_merge_outcome_report <home> <state> <task-id> <pr-url> <origin> [authority]
#
# <origin> says who observed the merge, because that decides whether the
# existing poll path also needs a local wake:
#   self - this home performed the merge.
#   poll - this home's merge poll detected the merge, so the canonical outcome
#          also wakes this home after any upward hop needed by a secondmate.
# Optional <authority> is away, attended, or external (the retired yolo and
# away-grant values are still accepted for a persisted authority written before
# the words model landed). Away, external, and the retired tags are appended to
# the ledger line; attended remains untagged. The merge entrypoint supplies its
# authority after forge acceptance, while the poll supplies the persisted
# identity-bound value or external when no matching record proves that this
# home authorized the merge.
#
# Returns 0 when the outcome is recorded (or already was), 2 on an invalid
# request, 3 when this home's own role or parent binding cannot be read well
# enough to say where the outcome belongs, and 1 on any other failure to
# record. A caller that has already merged must report a non-zero return rather
# than treat it as success: the merge landed and the record did not.
